embodied in Hall's Ohroniele. It is deserving of remark, ’
that the worthy prolate, in his laboriose attempts to
support Henry's most groundless pretensions to the
French crown, with singular appropriateness quotes
Pharamond as the orig-irater of the Salio Law, a
mythic personage, whose existence, there can be little
doubt, is as wholly nnsuhstantial and fictitious as the
elaims which the speaker is so disingenuonsly labour-
ing to support.

The speech attributed to the Duke of Exoter in
pp. 28-30‚-or rather, to speak with strict correctness,
the Earl of Dorset, for sneh at that period was his title,
-thongh based upon reality, as we learn from Hall's
Chroniele, bears marks, more particularly towards the
close, of Redmayne’s powers of expansiweness; and
while there is no roorn for doubt that he combatt'ed
the weighty objections raised hythe Earl of ¹ West
moreland, and stoutly supported the Arohbishop’s pro·
position, it would be rather too great a tax upon our
credulity to believe, making all allowanee for his
learned edueation in the Universities of Italy, that he
occupied a large proportion ot his address with a dia
quisition upon the prowess of ancient Rome, and the
spirit of patriotism that was unfailingly ewoked by the
dangers of the republic. His allusion (p. 29) to the
notive alliance even then existing between the peoples
of Scotland and Franoe (also mentioned in Hall’s ver-
sion) is deserving of remark ; an alliance which, com·
monning at a still earlier period, was destined to exist
for near two centuries atter, and to leave to a still later
period its traces upon the manners, institutione, lan·
