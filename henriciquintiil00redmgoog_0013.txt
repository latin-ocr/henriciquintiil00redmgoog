Tau three several memoirs of Henry the Filth, King
of England, printed in the present Volume‚ for the first
time, are in themselves sufficiently valuable and inte-
resting to deserve some attention at the hands of the
future historiam while an additional interest, perhaps,
is lent to them by the juxtaposition in which they are
placed. Though professing to give an- aceount of the
actions, motivas, and¹ career of -the same personage,
they do so from wholly different points of view ; and
they respectiuely reveal to us the character of one of
'the most popular monarchs in English Histwy, under
aspeots so widely dissimilar, that it is almost with
difficulty-so far, at all events, as the first and third
of these works are concerned-an uninformed or super-
ficial reader would recognize in them the postrait of
one and the same individual.

l'n the first of these Lives, Hemy is placed before
us iu hardly any other capacity than that of a scholar
and a philosopher 3 his deeds, whether in politice or iu.
uariare, being treated as merely supplemental and
aneillary to the enunciation of what we might term
“ wise saws and cruciarit instances,” in Shakspearian
phrase; in fact, as almost wholly subserviant to the
writer's evident purpose of setting him forth in those
lignes, and of. showing how a prinae, naturally cf vir-
tuous tendencies, noue the less commendable perhaps
