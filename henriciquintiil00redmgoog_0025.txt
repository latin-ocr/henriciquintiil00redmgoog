Latinssand, while giving play, in all probability, to his
imagination, has had the good fortune not to deviate
very widely from the truth.

The accusation of Sir John Oldcastle is next touched

desired, 'but with sufficient minuteness not to leave
us uninformed that Redmayne, unlike the earlier
historiens who had. narrated the story of Old-
