Manuscript is a copy, and probably the only one in⁴
*existence of the original work ;,.the date of the „ hand-
writing being the close of the loth or fimt quarter of
the 17th century. Redmayne‚ as already remarked,
composed the work in the latter part of tbe reign of
Henry VIII.2 the locality of the original, if indeed it
has survived to the present day, is, sofar astho Editor
has been able to assertam, unknown

In entering upon an analysis of the next sketnh, the
“Vareno Rbptbmioa' de H candro aalma? it is only from
the internal evidence afforded by the work itself that the
reader is enabled to discover the rank or status of
the author, and· thence to form an estimate of the

is evident proof that he was an ecclesiastic and a
member of the royal household3 for beyond all ques-
tion he, here , speaks of himself as reading, or rather
intoning‚ mass in'the King's presence. As tc any further
or olearer information beyond thia, or even inference,

’ relative to his personat history-except that in laba,

he identifies himself with the monks of westminster
Abbey, a foundation which evidently held a high
¹place in his regards—it seems impossible to arrive at
it either by indication or conjecture.¹
