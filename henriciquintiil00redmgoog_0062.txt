L. 1080, “ Vesttoit euros ooooam reparare potenter ’¹
seems to be wholly destitute of meaning, and the words
are brought together, to all appearance, solely for the
numeral letters whioh they eontain, and their eonse-
quent velue in a Chronogrammatio point of view.

The assertion in line 1106, that Oldoastle deolared
'¹ himself to be the Prophet Elijah, is to be found in other
works as well, Capgrave's aooount (Do Illum. Henr.)

arnong the number. The statement, however, in the
next line that “King Richard is said to be Enooh,''
must be construed, it is pretty evident, in an ironioal

sense, and, as bearing reference to the faot that
Thomas de Trumpyngton was suborned by the Duke of
Albany, with the oonnivanoe of Oldoastle, it was alleged,
to represent himself as the veritable King Riohard IL,
who had died in prison nearly twenty years before.

The arguments from Scriptum (ll. noo-1184) in
support of Henry's absurd olaims to- tbe Frenoh orowu
are ourious, and not improbably represent some of those
that were put forth by the learned canonists and
civilians of the day. The great fast, however, is wholly
ignored,thatHen1y was not the legal representative of
Edward 111, say nothing of the unsubstantiality of
Edward’s own elaims to the throne of Franoe.

The aooouut of the charges made against Oldoastle,
in p. 157, is evidently derived from the same souroe as
that given by Oapgrave (De Illaetr. Hear.); if, indeed,
Oapgrave was not indebted for his narrative to the pre
sent work. They both relate, and in the same sequence,

how that Oldoastle was aooused of refirsing to prayto the · ῑ

Virgin and the Saints ; of asserting that eonfession to ¹God
alone is sufficient, without the intercession of man;
of denying {transubstantiatam of advocating suoh doe-
trines as would receive the name of “Communium'’ at the
present day; andos considering ohurohes as so many

Ἴ ² Deo is probably the eoueet rcadng for die in l. 1216.
