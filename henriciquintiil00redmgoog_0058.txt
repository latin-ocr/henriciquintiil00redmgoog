as taking place shortly before that date '“in the ‘Looy
Aaron the back side of Charing Oross’' The ‘lace' 01
Elmham (a'mistake evidently for ‘lomb represents, no
· doubt, the dense wood with which tbe spot was covered
in those days, the trees 01 which were probably the
immediate predecessore 01 the more orderly “Elms ’' of
the reign of Henry VIII.
, The “parpes’f 01 Lanoore, where Oldcastle was met
, by his followers on the Twelith day, or Epiphany, 1414,
with the view, it was said, of capturing or slaying the
King, was probablya deep pit or spring 01 water that

The mention 01 the ‘¹ Fons Petrosus ’¹' and “ Mons

the Lollards should be defeated and suffer punishment, is
worthy 01 remarks by the ¹ “ I'oas Patrone is probably
meant the spring or pond anciently called “Baynard’s
Watering” (now ‘Bayswater’) which supplied the London'
