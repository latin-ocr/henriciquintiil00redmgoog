version whioh are nowhere alluded to in the prose
History3 while in thelabim, a work of considerable
bulk, thereis of course very muoh to which no allusion Ι
is made in the later compilation In spite of all the

= attempts made by the author in his Prooemium,

pylo-81, to suggest plausible reasons for his writing
this additional History--reasons which, from the ob-
seurity of his language‚ cannot perhaps be so exaotly
appreciated aa, if more olearly stated, they might have
been-there seem to be some grounds' for believing that
the writer has not given the real metire t'or taking in
hand the present work. In p. 81, where he says that the
things narrated were either witnessed by the Compiler
himself, or were learnt by him from the faithful relation,
both in words and writing‚ of others who had been
present, he seems distautly to hint at the truth, and
no more. Thai truth, there is fair ground for supposing‚
consiste in this3 that, sinee writing his prose Histoi-y,
,he had seen the History of the same reign, or, at all
events, the first half of it, now known¹ as “the Ohaplain's
Aooount :'' even more, tou, than this, it is not unlikely

¹ that the Ohaplain himself (who had accompanied Henry

throughout his ¹first Frenoh expedition), may have
plaoed tho work in his hands, and even have given him
some verbal informationes well„ Be this, however, as
it may, the¹ resemblance of the Liber Metricos to the
“ Chaplaiu’s Aeoount’' is patent in almost every page ;
while, at the same time, the writer must have been in-

, debted also to other souroes of information as new

matter is omasionally to be found whioh the Chaplain
hes failed to insert. This Metrieal Histmy, there ean be

i » little doubt then, was intended by Elmham to be a
κ supplement to his Prose one, and that too, based upon

the best authority within his reaolu From an ocea-
