10 Chapter XVII„ pp. 110, 141, allusion is evidently
made to the special services performed at Canterbmy
Cathedral on the visit thereos the Emperor Sigismund
and Henry V. A literal translation of these singular
lines, ’0111111011 interlinear references to the Psalmo
and Anthems chaunted on the several days of the
week, and upon which a vast amount of unprofitable
lahour hasbeen evidently expended, is impossible.

The lines quoted inplet as having been written
by the followers 01 the Emperor Sigismund on his
departure, 'after his long stay in England‚ show that
¹tlaey at least were sufficiently well pleased with their
visit here, and felt regret at leaving the good things

³ ’ 01 “happy England” behind them. This eulogy

(11.915-8), which we learn both from the present work
and 110111 Oapgrave‚ they took care to have multiplied
hy numerous copies, and dispersed in the streete and
highways though ithae really nothing meritorious in it,
