The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
¹ they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master 01 the Rolls with the sanction 01 the Treasnry.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a careful
consideration of 'the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master 01 the Rolls “ was well
calculated for the accomplishment 01 this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangementS,
without unnecessary expense.” ’

They expressed their approbation 01 the proposal that
each chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as 10 represent with all possible correct·
0000 the text of each writer, derived from a collation 01 the
best MSS, and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative 01 the various readings They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should Ι
contain, iu addition 10 the particulars proposed hythe
Master 01 the Rolls, a biographical account 01 the author,
Ἴ 00 far as anthentic materials existed for that purpose, and
an estimato of his historical credibility and value.

ln compliance with the order of the Treasury, the

, Master 01 the Rolls has selected for publication for the

present year such works as he considered best calculated
to fill up the chasms¹ existing in the printed materials of
English history3 and 01 these works the present is one.
