, On the seth of J anuary 1857, the Mastcr of the Rolls

¹ submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication

of materials for the History of this Country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange·
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
giren, in the first instance, to such materials as were most
scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chroniele or historical document
to be edited should be treated in the· same way as if the
editor were engaged 011 au Editio Princeps3 and for this
purpose the most correct text should be formed from an

’ accurate collatiou of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a brief
account of the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no‘other
note or comment was tosbe allowed, except what might be
necessary to establish the correctness of the text. ‚
